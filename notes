import {
  GraphQLSchema,
  GraphQLObjectType,
  GraphQLInputObjectType,
  GraphQLList,
  GraphQLNonNull,
  GraphQLID,
  GraphQLString,
  GraphQLInt,
  GraphQLBoolean,
} from 'graphql';
import {
  globalIdField,
  connectionDefinitions,
  connectionFromPromisedArray,
  connectionArgs,
  mutationWithClientMutationId,
} from 'graphql-relay';

IMPORTANT LESSONS:

For connection object in Relay, if you want to customize cursor, pagination, etc - do NOT use connectionFromArray. Instead implement resolver function yourself.
When throwing error in mutateAndGetPayload just RESOLVE ERROR OBJECT. DO NOT THROW.
